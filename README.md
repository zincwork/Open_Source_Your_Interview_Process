# Open Source Your Interview Process :shipit:

##### This is an open list of teams that are ‘open sourcing’ their interview processes. We want to propose a new standard of transparency in interviewing to insprire more trust in hiring. If we’re able to share notes, we can learn from each other and all spend less time interviewing. 

Here are the steps to take part:
- Open an issue and share the stages of your interview process. Optionally add what your companies hiring achievements 
- Make a pull request if you wish to share interviewing material; tests, interview questions, on-boarding resources (anything worth sharing :+1:

The top ten processes listed are for developer roles in leading web3 organisations.

Let's open source interviewing :raised_hands:
